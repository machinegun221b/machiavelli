The first episode is basically just an introduction to the series. It answers questions like why rebuilding and what this series is going to be about. And the episode is called: stripped back. And the name works on two levels (see Day 71). I also wanted to call it Stripped Back because it’s an honest account of my journey and story. It’s me trying to hide nothing, and I wanted that to resonate in the name. 


I named the second episode of the rebuilding series "traumas be baaaad dude", which at least I think is funny because this was the only phrase I could think of in that moment to completely summarise what I was talking about in the video AND not be taking myself too seriously. That’s supposed to be ironic because the contents of the video are really serious.


In this second episode we’re discussing the past in order to identity/ figure out/ point out the problems that need to be solved!


And since it was just me talking about things from memory and it was a one-take thing, I also wrote down something which I believe is a bit more coherent and probably more detailed description of those same events that I recount in the video. I think it offers a little bit of a better understanding.
