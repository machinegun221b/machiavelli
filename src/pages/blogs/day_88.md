Yes, nothing is black and white in this world and yet the main part of moksha seems to be that you need to be clear of everything - maybe that’s why the world is such a messed up place - a place of rejects.
Ok, am I making you comfortable now? Want a warm cup tea maybe?


More on things that make not a lot of sense:
Why do we grow then? From that pain and suffering, learn things and come out “the other side”. Some even luck out and have better lives. 
What’s that, becoming empathetic? Understanding and being responsive to other’s pain?


If you were supposed to suffer and only suffer for that one thing for your whole Janma, you wouldn’t grow, right? You wouldn’t be better.


What about the people who suffer, but make others suffer more than they themselves do?
What about their karma? ‘Cause that doesn’t seem like something people do in fact grow out of. Does that mean those people will never attain moksha because this would be a cycle that repeats itself every time around? 
And speaking of loops, if the things that happen to you are the things that you did to someone else in your past life, what about the perpetrators? In this life and the next and so on and so forth… would there be no end, technically? 


Vindictive or in order to vindicate, whatever it maybe, why would it be so - due to lack of a better term maybe - petty? Are we to believe that?
