Did you ever think as a kid that you would end up where you are right now? Maybe some of you did. Maybe some of you dreamed of having a decent job - any job, pay your way through life until the sweet release of death along with a nice, loving family at some point and of course there’d be fun, right?

Something I’ll never understand is that idea of fun - going to bar, pub or a restaurant, eating and drinking until your heart’s content and then finally leaving. I haven’t actually seen a scenario in which everybody does in fact go home after a good, meaningful conversation - I’m not even asking for in depth. I mean, some of We do. But overall, nope. And even that some of We is a tiny fraction.

How is shutting brain off and engaging in mindless play supposed to be fun?

Anyway, when I first asked the question, did you ever think you’d actually end up where you are now - I meant it more like “Who tf knew any of our lives would turn out this way?”
As in any of this. I for one didn’t think this is where I’d be living, or this is what I’d be doing with my life. I mean, social media even - to think I actually have multiple accounts and I ACTUALLY post stuff. Pictures and videos, including my FACE?!

I always thought I’d travel a lot more, study physics, robotics, math - live a different kind of life basically. 

Ok, no I get it now - probably not everybody’s lives are that different from what they thought it’d be like. 

It seems like this one is a sad sack kinda story. So let me end it with this -
My story is in fact very different from the story I made up in my head for years if not decades - more like a decade and half. I have so many things now I never dared to even dream of. I have a life very different from the one I imagines, and the truth is - I think I’m happier now than my dreams could’ve made it possible. 

Yes, maybe everything could’ve been nice but the reality’s pretty damn good. And moreover, the story’s not over yet.
