I hope to soon discuss the problem of the disconnect between language and reality. How language is weak ontology. I’d also like to link this to the development of technology and how it could potentially solve this problem.


I’d also like to discuss the heavy reliance of the future of religion on philosophy, both analytic as well as continental. 


So if anybody has any thoughts, please reach out to me through the contact section at the top.
Thenks ;)
