Again, thank you for sticking around. The stuff I’ve been writing has been deeply personal and intimate. And I haven’t really been able to write about much else at the time. I did write a bit about religion though. We’ll see what I post.


I might post some stuff from those missed dates in either PPS or SYM. Need to maybe polish all of it a bit. Anyway, you’ll see. But I don’t know when I’ll get around to editing it. Pretty much everything I usually write and post here is never edited, at most there’s some proof-reading. 


So… it might take a while (eeeek). But thank you yet again! For sticking ‘round.  ;)


Oh also! I’ve posted some new stuff, check them out!
