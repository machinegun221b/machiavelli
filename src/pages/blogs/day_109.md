It’s funny how it’s the people closest to you who have the ability to hurt you the most. It’s like a cruel joke someone’s trying to play on you. I mean, it can’t be nature, right? Nature couldn’t be so cruel?


But then you look around and you see the reality all around you. It is nature. The duality of human nature is something deeply embedded in Nature itself. It’s something we’ve received from it. All of us. Everything that’s living or non-living. The irony: it’s a blessing and a curse. 


When it’s someone you love, someone you truly care about. Everything just hurts exponentially. That’s the double edged sword. “Love” with it, the pain comes infinite. 


You try to run away from the vastness of the universe, where do you go? You’re inside it and it inside of you. No escape.


(I’m not gonna say, “Man that got dark’. If you want to, you say it. Byeee)


Anyway.
Am I not allowed to write such things here? “It’s my page, I can do what I want to.”
