During and after my time suffering trauma, I looked everywhere for resources on how to heal and move forward from the events that had transpired. I went to therapists, read a bunch of books, looked to other people for guidance or support, turned toward yoga and meditation, lived life on very specific terms, searched all over the internet and did anything that could remotely even help.

After years of searching, I came across certain resources that helped me through it all. And as time transpired I learned a lot and started to heal.

But what I learned was this:
The world is huge and the internet, vaster. There are a number of things that could help but they’re scattered all over, and so, we stumble across very few in our time-consuming journey. Finding a number of these things all in one place has been a pipe dream for me.

But over the years, I’ve accumulated a set of resources that have helped me and continue to do so.

So I hope, the people who end up stumbling across this, at least, will be a bit luckier or that my story will be a bit more useful or helpful. Whether it be with hope or guidance or just knowing that you’re not alone.
