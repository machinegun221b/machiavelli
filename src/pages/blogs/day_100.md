If these past few years have taught me anything, it’s that these things happen far too much to far too many people. They change the course of our lives, they become the defining moments of our lives. 

I’ve learned there are far too many people out there. Way too many. And so many feel guilty or responsible. They feel like they were at fault, even if they were only a child. 

We hide and run, we struggle to find a way and even die trying to pave our own. All because of the actions of someone else. Someone who doesn’t even try to hide. Or have any shame, who think they have every right and who think they can threaten you when they’re the only people responsible for any kind of crime. 

No remorse, no regret. Just entitlement. There are so many people out there who seem to walk every day in the shadow of a monster’s unabashed deeds.

And it’s not uncommon to hear stories of bad shit happening every day. But we rarely come across conversations discussing the solutions for all of this, even when we may try to kickstart these conversations ourselves. Instead, we tell ourselves we aren’t capable and let some random strangers worry about that. 

I hope to one day do much more about shit like this, but for now: This is what I can do.
