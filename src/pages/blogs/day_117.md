Is it just me or are the swiggy people just getting worse and worse as the days go by.
Horrible attitudes of course. But who tf yells at a customer for no reason.
And it’s more and more people everyday .


You empathise when it’s a few or once in a while. You try to look at things from other povs/perspectives


But here’s the thing
You can’t go empathising with everybody, cause then who’s taking care of you?
Oh poor them let me help.
It’s supposed to be their job right?
And it’s not like they’re nice when you do help.


We can all go like
Oh poor dude. His life sucks. Yeah well so does everybody’s.
If a shitty life is the accepted excuse for everything then no one’s gonna be responsible for anything! Ever.
