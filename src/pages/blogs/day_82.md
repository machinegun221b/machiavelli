Continuing from yesterday…
So if that truly is a problem then maybe this is a possible solution then? Unisex pronouns. For everything, all the time. Would it be confusing? I’m not sure, maybe the rules of the language or the way we speak may adapt a little in order to make it more clarifying if such a confusion did happen to be such a huge issue. Whatever it is, if people have a problem with the changing rules of a language that is undead, I truly do not know what to tell ya. I mean, that’s the whole point of a living language, it evolves - like us - through time. With time, it takes on new properties, shedding old ones. Trying to fit into a new generation of minds and new lifestyles. You cannot styme this process. It’s as natural as the other thing we were talking about yesterday - you know, that thing that people wanna pretend is so very unnatural. 

Anyway.
I feel like unisex pronouns are the way to go. Also, in the time we live in, if you can’t adapt something as small as a tiny change in language then… how do you expect to survive the rest of living?

Moving on!

You will NOT believe what I saw the other day. I was browsing, for some serveware - bowls to be specific - when I came across, catch this: “unisex bowls”.
I mean, when did bowls choose a sex? How is their gender even coming up?! How are we, seriously, assigning gender to BOWLS?!
Seriously, it’s not a “mad mad world”. It’s a “what has this world come to?”
