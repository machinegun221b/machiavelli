Speaking of who TF knew, who tf knew the world would be this way? When we’re born, of course, we’re oblivious to even what are own shit or pee is. I mean, tiny little boys peeing right into their own faces? You can’t make this shit up. 


The awfulness of the world is definitely something none of us would’ve expected but neither are the beautiful wonders. Of course, from an early age we’re taught to except the best, dream of beautiful things and look for the good in people, and we do also inherently have a positive bias. But we’re also taught to beware of strangers and to never take candy from them. And we do also have fight/flight instincts - so we know there’s danger in our worlds too. 


But we grow up hoping the good outweighs the bad - or so the stories we’re told makes us assume. I mean, Ramayana anybody? 


Anyway, the point is the world is a mix of everything. There are literally all kinds of people. Kinds we can’t imagine in both the good and the bad. Unfortunately, after a point it’s just a lot heuristic biases in our minds. 
Definitely, not something we expected when we were born. 


But a lot of the older generation also probably didn’t expect to live in an age where there’s AI or even Google. And the ones before them - a time where people would leave planet earth. And us, we don’t know what wondrous shit might happen in the next 5 - 10 years, let alone a lifetime. 


Space Travel, AI, a sci-fi storybook ending or a dystopian ending - those are things we do actually expect now - so… can’t wait to see, right?!
Will we actually create a blackhole that consumes us? We don’t know yet. 


Not everything I write has to be great ;) Some would love to say none of it is, but come on - let’s be real. Set aside that petty shit at least once in a while, yeah?
