A few months ago, I felt a shift. In everything as a whole. A few weeks ago, that shift started to get narrowed down to myself. I felt like I was finally able. Like I could do things, function and take on some more things. For those who feel lost reading this, go to the piece from 12/03. 


To me this feeling felt like Ground Zero. And I figured I’d document my journey. This progress of everything from this moment that I felt like I got to Ground Zero. It’s already been about 3 to 4 weeks since I felt like I was at Ground Zero, so here’s an account of everything I did starting then!


I went and joined a gym, started working on the series I call “rebuilding” on YouTube. And since I’ve been doing this YouTube series, I’ve started to learn some video editing and the like. I am also currently working on a podcast which I will soon put out on YouTube and other podcast platforms! I think that is what I’m most excited about, but yeah there’s a few other things I’ve been working on. 




P.S: I have been sleeping a lot better I’d say.
