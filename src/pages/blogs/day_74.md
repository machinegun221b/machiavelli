Along Came Rome
- - Cue: Adelle - Skyfall (“This is the end…”)	- -


The Jewish way of thinking about God was something that a lot of other people couldn’t get their heads around. Not only could they not understand it, but the stubbornness of the people of Jerusalem when it came to their God got the Romans infuriated. 


The idea they espoused was that God could not be bound by stone; no structure nor words could contain or represent the totality of what God really was. 


Triggered by a lack of empathy toward these ideas and this way of life, the Romans decided to embrace that fury and level Jerusalem. And that’s what they did in 70 CE. 
But as we know today, the Romans did not succeed in ending them. The people of this nation spread across the world in search of refuge. And wherever they went, they succeeded in never giving in, when it came to their God.
