Do you ever wonder, what if parrots evolved to be the best singers on the planet? Not like birds singing but like better than humans. 
I mean, that’s what they do right, copy our sounds - not “words”.


Imagine if somebody could write the music, get a parrot to sing along the notes - OMG has anyone ever tried to make anything with parrots - like using them for harmonies?


How stupid or brilliant is this?
Validate. XD
