Turns out most religions start out with someone with an “open mind”. And yet, as they grow into fully formed institutions of religion, their primary purpose becomes breeding out “closed minds”. 


I’d like to take a beat here and paste this quote:
“anyone with complete conviction about anything, especially if that person was an expert,
was bound to shake anybody who had an open mind. That - is the advantage of having a closed mind.” 
Apparently said by John F. Kennedy as paraphrased by Richard Holloway!


How orthodoxy is defined here, is as being someone with a closed mind. For a person who’s closed off their mind, the only challenge left is to thrust these views onto others. Because their minds are firmly made-up that they are IN the Right. 


Whereas heretics are people who oppose the status quo. They give you new ways of thought and opinions that may threaten the status quo.


While heretics and orthodox people are found everywhere, they hold a prominent position in the world of religion. Because they are the ones who make or break a religion.
