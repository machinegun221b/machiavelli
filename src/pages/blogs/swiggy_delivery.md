Your services have been incredibly upsetting. I have repeatedly had to interact with awfully rude delivery agents. Not only that, they start the call rude, and quite frankly do yell. 
I have deep appreciation and gratitude to the very few, who go the extra mile in order to do their job - not just right - but well. But the majority seem to want us to never use their services again. 

The most recent experience was the worst one so far and it is what has led me to write this email. I talked to your customer service regarding the same and while they did take care of the issue by ensuring that such an incident would not happen again, they also suggested I email you here.

My problem is not just that one delivery agent was so incredibly rude but that Swiggy seems to have this problem. I've had more than just one experience to come to such a conclusion.

Most days, when I need to order something on your app, it is the most dreaded part of my day. The conversations that I need to have with your agents are the worst parts of those days. 

It's not only the rude behaviour and screaming and shouting at the top of their voices but them acting like we're doing something wrong. Like we're treating them wrong, when in reality, it would literally be the first conversation that we'd ever have with them.

The same problem does not seem to be prevalent in other delivery services: not only amazon but blinkit and zomato as well.
This only makes me think, why this is such a huge problem with Swiggy.

I am beyond disappointed and deeply upset. I have no words to describe how horribly your services affect us on a regular basis. 

If we hadn't paid for the Swiggy One services, we'd have abandoned ship long ago. But in putting that trust in you and paying for your services, you've not only taken advantage of your loyal customers but have betrayed consumer trust.

I do not want to take a single person's name here, because this isn't a one time thing. Since it is such a casual occurrence I have no choice but to think this is systemic. I believe you either treat your employees that badly or your hiring team needs better screening processes. 

So please look into how you can solve this problem at a larger scale.
