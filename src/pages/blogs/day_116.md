I haven’t written much about religion recently. The more I read and the more I began to understand the history of the world’s religious awakening, I think I began to see certain things with a much brighter light.


So I think I will address it again with prominence in the podcast I will be doing in a few months time. But it will be with a different lens, a different focus.


Until then, I’ll leave you with this.
All of the primary ideologies that gave rise to so many religions.
Now eclipsed by the rigorous social construct that everybody’s forced to fit into.
