That was the name I wanted to give to the third video of this series. 
And THAT was because it seemed that I should do these videos in a logical order rather than putting the Ground Zero video first. 


The whole reason I began with this series, was because I came upon this feeling one day like I was finally AT Ground Zero. 
Until then, for the past few years, it felt like I was just drowning and wailing, hanging on for dear life. With no land in sight. 


And over the past few months, it felt like I was finally coming in contact with branches and rocks. Some tiny little form of control over my life. 
I started working on things I cared about. The things I loved and wanted to do.


I was beginning to see glimpses of a future, beginning to imagine and be fascinated by everything life had to offer. 
Seeing light beyond the darkness and a beautiful feeling that is just within my reach beyond all the pain and sadness. That rhymed XD, I did not plan that one either. 


It seems like things have been rhyming a lot of late. Like: 
“It was never about feelings, it was always about dealings.”  


So coming back to my point, yeah! I finally came into reach a point. Land. And it felt, with almost certainty, that I’d reached some level ground. My Ground Zero. 


And so I figured, I wanna document this journey. From zero to wherever I go, how much ever I grow (I AM NOT PLANNING THIS. These are all words that are just coming in in one go!)


So I started: Thre Rebuilding Series. The plan was to provide you guys with some introduction as to what this rebuilding thing WAS, to begin with. And then to give you the background ‘cause I can’t just go like, “This is my Ground Zero” ‘cause then you’d be all confused watching this whole f*@#ing thing.


So, then after these two videos would be the Ground Zero video. FINALLY! (All good things take time, iz cool.)


But by the time I got around to posting this video, things were happening, yet again. 
Changing. 
I mean, it’s a good thing you know, life can’t just stand still. So it’s good to keep moving. And whatever it has been, I still choose to see all of this as moving Forward. As progress.


So what happened? And why am I calling this “resilience vs tenacity”? Why are we using these words and what exactly is the difference?
