I got nothing.

I’m all dried out right now.

All there seems to be there

Is just this sorry attempt at sentences

And I can’t even think of anything about nothing

This, to be honest, has been going on since yesterday

But I’ve been trying to “power through”

And just squeeze any last drops out

But it’s just 

Not

Happening!

Today

So 

Yeah

This is what you get

Ta-ta!

I’m embarrassed to post this

God

ARGHHH! Ugh

Fine then

Ciao
