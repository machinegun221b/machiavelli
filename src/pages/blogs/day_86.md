So I haven’t posted anything in a while. But I’m not starting from 0 again today. The reason for that being the fact that I have been writing. A lot actually. A lot more than usual. But I didn’t feel like I should post any of it. 


I’ve been writing all kinds of things. Mostly, they’re very personal. And I’m not ready to share them yet. Maybe I will sometime soon, but not right now. 


I was also sick for a few days there, but there were things that I’d written for other purposes - around that time - which fit in perfectly over here (at least to me, it was perfect) and so I uploaded those things to the website sometime last week. So if you haven’t, you can read those.


Thank you to those who stuck around and have waited this long, and to those who couldn’t wait - I’m sorry. 


All in all, I’m glad I’ve been doing those and I’m grateful to those who have contributed in any way at all - including by being readers. 


Sayonara, for today. 


I’ll be back with some new stuff tomorrow for sure. ;)
