There’s every kind of person on this planet.
Varieties.
I’ve met a few I’d say.


What you do, matters a lot more than who you are. Exhibits are respected, fake sophistications, facades and superficial characteristics are respected.


You’re forced to express yourself to get anything in return.


My problem is with the ethical and moral values that I espouse which are bound to these idioms.


I do not want to lose who I am in the pursuit of these superficial displays.


Your work speaks for you.
Show who you are in the work you do, the way you carry yourself. Show the world who you are. Stop hiding yourself or shrinking yourself.


Show up for yourself 
Express yourself. Boldly.


The money
That’s superficial
Societal
Structural
Something we’ve made a requirement
Stop paying attention to it
Create value in the work you do.
