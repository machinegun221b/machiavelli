When you live a life of immense hardships, suffering, when you go through a lot of pain - is that all because of punarjanma? Does it mean that in your previous janma, you did the things that happened to you? Or someone (I mean, God) decided that these are the things that this person deserves. Do you think your pain tolerance, your attitudes and character are all factored in? I like to think it is, ‘cause otherwise how would it even be “fair” or “justifiable” right?

But then again, these same religious texts say that The One Thing isn’t exactly involved in these kinds of things. You just go through cycles of life until your soul is “cleansed” or “light-weight” enough to “be free” or “float away” into a higher dimension. But then it would make no sense right? Someone would have to be there to pass judgement on how the events the next life need to be as a result of the previous one. 

I know I don’t know all that much about religion yet, but it really doesn’t seem to me that a lot of thought went into putting these religious systems in place, and especially when people wrote those religious texts stating all this. 

Anyway, there’s a lot more to the thought I had regarding this. Should I continue that in a separate text or wrap it up here?
Let’s see…
Also, who decides when I life is to end. Like, what’s the criteria for that? Is it like “yeah, your life of suffering is enough, let’s get you onto the next cycle.” Or is it like “you’ve repented your sins, you’ve total living has met our standards so yeah - come, you shall attain moksha now”?

Then there’s people who seem to have a balanced mixture of the good and the bad, what’s all that about? Shouldn’t a balanced mixture mean their previous life probably put them on the path to moksha or something? But what? They didn’t make the cut somehow, and so must continue to be make their souls lighter still? 
Ok I’m getting sucked into a spiral here, moving on then.
