I’m making a series on YouTube, so here is what I wrote for the first episode of this series!
It’s called rebuilding.

Hi internet, 
This is my first ever video making and editing experience. So, please have mercy.


And have a great day! Let's be kind.

Welcome, to my first bout of narcissism here on YouTube! 
This video is an introduction to this series of videos that I'm calling Rebuilding! It's the rebuilding of my life and myself. And now you understand the narcissism. 


Remember, most importantly: no one's forcing you to watch this. But if you do watch this you can step away at any point in time. 


The first episode is called stripped back because it literally is peeling back on myself. Taking a second to acknowledge and begin this journey. The journey where I will be building myself back up from scratch. It's stripped back, also because I'm just bones, if anything right now. We'll be adding the flesh, muscle (literally), the skin, and everything that comes after - along the way. 


What you'll see in the coming videos in this series is a story:
This is a story of the present. A story that is deep, personal. A story about what's happening with me.

As I've found my way through this and continue to keep finding a way, what I've not found is many stories of the steps or the moments it took to get there. So, I hope this will help those who need it as well.
