I wanted to talk about “Karma” and the opportunity presented for growth in such a case. With all the religion stuff, there’s definitely a few things that I’ve been seeing in a different light. So first, let me talk about that: what I’ve realised about the concept of karma - something in plain sight that until recently hadn’t been apparent to me.

The concept of Karma is so well-embedded in our culture that even when we’re talking about something else entirely, it tends to seep into conversation. 

To me, at least, the word Karma can be used in a few different ways: the religious thing of course, then there’s the use of the word with the same meaning but not tied to the punarjanma and such concepts so tightly, then there’s the third way - a more informal, slang kinda way.

But, when you do infact think about it, the concept is so well-embedded in our minds - the meaning never changes in any of the scenario. 
And yes, I do realize I may not have been clear about what I’m trying to say here. Oh well.

Maybe it’s the language too.

It’s basically like this: when you translate that word “karma” to English (or a foreign language) - we seem to use it only in a case-specific kinds way. Unlike in theregional languages here, in which we use it as a slang and use the word for anything and everything - from using it to curse somebody to saying good things about them - of course as is the nature of the word.

I mean I suppose it’s different for the people who don’t practice this kind of religion or are surrounded by people who do from an early age - because then of course it’s cacse-specific usage.

Whereas when it’s embedded since childhood, we never think twice about it. I mean, even we think we’re using it as slang, the meaning seems to always lie in it indeed always being about punarjanma and karma - no matter how we say it.

And it’s seems to be how we see everyday life too. Never even thinking twice about it!_
