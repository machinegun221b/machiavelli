No matter how you choose to look at it, lies are stories people come up with to orate instead of the truth in an effort to further their own cause. Whether we lie to spare someone from pain, or in an effort to lighten the mood temporarily as a tactic as a deflection of the truth, or we simply think we’re right in saying what we’re saying for the listener’s “own sake”, it is nothing more than a mere attempt to satisfy our own self-conceit. A self-importance. 


I’m not saying that I’m free of this guilt, we all do it. I’m just trying to point out that by doing this, over and over again, we’re changing the course so many events and why this should matter is because we’re robbing the person we’re hiding the truth from of making their own choices on matters that clearly concern them. Because otherwise, why else would we go through the process of coming up with an elaborate form of deceit, however short lived. 


We want to spare the other person, yes. But we also want to spare ourselves, from having to the difficult task of delivering the plain truth that carries a worth that is too intense for us to process as regularly. We’re trying to save time for ourselves by avoiding having to go into a long discussion with these people, and even ourselves. 
All I’m saying is, maybe, we should consider the fact that lies are selfish. No matter how you look at it.
If you think they are or can be self-less, bring forth your arguments.
