When you have something
You fear losing it
When you have nothing
You sit alone in the emptiness
When you have pain
You have pain


If you’re not afraid of losing it
You’re not not paranoid
You can’t take things for granted
If you like being alone
You’re “missing out” on life
If you’re in pain
You’re in pain
If you like pain, you’re a masochist
