People need God. For various reasons. They need God to relinquish control. They need God to rely on. They need God to blame a chain of events on somebody. They need God to assuage their guilt. They need God to Judge them and provide them with validation. They need God to punish them or others.


They need to believe in “the unknowable” so they can think that this isn’t all there is to life, that isn’t all there is, not just the people and the life but the world itself. To feel better. Others in this category need to feel better in the opposite sense, that death isn’t all there is. 


It’s God that we showcase our anger toward when there is nothing left. And then that we ask forgiveness from, when we fear or are guilty. All the emotions that make us act, all emotions that make us sulk and sink - they all trickle down as they make their way towards God.


God plays so many more roles in each life. Even in the ones that don’t believe. God plays all kinds of characters. 


It’s funny that we say that we’re the ones playing all these characters in God’s great theatre workshop, when in fact it’s the other way around.

If you’re wondering about the role of God in the lives of those who don’t believe, it’s just that sometimes we wish that we believed or that God did in fact exist, so there would be an outlet for all that anger.
