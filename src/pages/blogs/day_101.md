Is it just me or have you had a similar experience? It’s so easy to make adults laugh. Wayyyyy easier than making our own generation laugh - of course there’s those few, handful of people who literally will laugh at anything, but that’s not what I mean. And yes, I am generalising a bit. But my experience has been that it’s so much easier to make older people laugh. Of course, there’s the possibility that I am an old soul myself, or that I have Boomer humour.


But you know what I think it is? I think they’re just happy. Happy around a younger generation that lives a life far freer than they had the privilege to live. 


They do come from a  generation where bending to someone’s will and abuse were not only perfectly normalised but were in fact respectable. So maybe they laugh at us because of our petty grievances too?


Yeah, not that’s probably it. Of course, they also grew with a lot a less of everything else than us - so yeah that makes more sense, ‘cause there’s no way in hell that we could ever relate and be actually cognizant of all that and have the ability to turn it into a relatable joke!
